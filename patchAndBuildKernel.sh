# The first part patches the kernel so that it compiles
# And copies over a file (vgettimeofday.o) that was compiled for 32 bits
# The system is prepared, and the first "make" process is started. It will fail
# because of issues in vdso32, the 32-bit part of the kernel
# In the second part of the patch and make process
# The file vdso32.so.dbg is copied over to vdso32 (which should fix the remaining build issue)
# The kernel and the modules are compiled, and the modules are installed.
# Note that if vdso32.so.dbg is copied before the first make command, it will still fail
# There's probably something in the Makefile for vdso32 that needs the dbg file to be absent
# for it to build itself properly
